      (Italian: Cucina italiana) is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the
      ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian
      Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the world together with
      waves of Italian diaspora. Significant changes occurred with the
      colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes,
      capsicums, maize and sugar beet â€” the latter introduced in quantity in the
      18th century. It is one of the best-known and most appreciated
      gastronomies worldwide.

      Spaghetti (is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta" target="_blank">pasta</a>.
      It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta,
      spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with
      vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum
      wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used,
      but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of
      spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin spaghetti.

    <h1>Spiders</h1>
    <p>
      Snakes are some of the most feared animals, up there with spiders and
      centipedes for many. Some people even suffer from ophidiophobia, an
      intense fear of snakes. This fear is not unfounded. Our bodies have
      evolved to fear animals that could potentially harm us, and some snakes
      certainly can be deadly.
